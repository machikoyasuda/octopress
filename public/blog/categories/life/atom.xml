git commit -m "Add a new blog post on commits."
</code></p>

<p>I have a strange, short-term memory these days. Memories will come back to me like vivid movie scenes, but if you asked me what I did seven days ago â€” I might come up blank. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the learning and working.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s been changing my week so far though, has been the simple act of committing each minor project accomplishment as a git commit.</p>

<p>Version Control on git is not just for easier collaborating and sharing work, I&rsquo;ve realized. I can look back on my commits from a month or two months back and re-read some jQuery I wrote to refresh my brain on syntax and methods. Or I can go back and see what I&rsquo;ve done in the past week.</p>

<p>Projects are daunting. Starting at zero and trying to get to the finish line in one long leap is a daunting leap to make. Instead of fretting over getting it perfect the first time, I&rsquo;ve been celebrating each tiny little commit. Because it&rsquo;s those little steps in between that will get me there.</p>
