			<h2>Today:</h2>

<p>Today our group took a different approach. We talked about our main back-end roadblocks and broke up into groups to tackle them together.</p>

<p>What did I learn? The amazing/insane/crazy thing in programming is when you think you&rsquo;ve applied all the same methods to your friend&rsquo;s project &mdash; and the results are not the same as yours. Group-debugging is much better than self-debugging.</p>

<h2>Roadblocks:</h2>

<p>My personal roadblocks, prioritized:</p>

<ol>
<li><p>Back-end: URL generation + new Firebase collection. This involves a sequence of steps:</p></li>
<li><p>Create new Firebase collection</p></li>
<li>Generate new URL accordingly</li>
<li>Prompt user to bookmark that link, share with friends</li>
</ol>


<p>Everything else after this is not so much part of the MVP.</p>

<p>It would be nice to learn things like: jQuery Mobile, Sass, more about viewports/media queries, mobile interactions&hellip;</p>

<h1>Tomorrow:</h1>

<ol>
<li>Testing: how to set up Karma</li>
<li>Still work on URL.</li>
</ol>


<h2>Next week:</h2>

<ol>
<li>Deploying!</li>
</ol>

		<div class="content">
			<h2>Today:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Learning about <a href="https://gist.github.com/machikoyasuda/6373231">try-catch-finally-throw</a> See the gist there.</li>
<li>try: the function you are testing</li>
<li>catch(e): the fall-back function in case try does not work.</li>
<li>finally: always runs &ndash; usually an alert. optional.</li>
<li>throw: define different variations of the catch &ldquo;e&rdquo;, like NaN, out of range exceptions.</li>
<li>Did a little <a href="https://github.com/machikoyasuda/mustache-js-test">Mustache.js</a>. See the code there.</li>
<li>I think I will get to implement some Mustache.js in my Datamap project. I will insert things like Census report name or table name into the JSON, and use it later on the front-end.</li>
<li>On my project, I added some new stylings, but no new JavaScript functions. The data now persists to database.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Roadblocks:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Should users be able to edit item names? If so, what&rsquo;s the best mobile UI for that? A button or something else?</li>
<li>Tomorrow I plan to start generating unique URL with an unique ID for each checklist. That ID must somehow correspond with the correct Firebase collection.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tonight:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Figure out how to run my Jasmine/Karma tests.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code challenge:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start nit-picking for Ruby and JS excercism.</li>
<li>Start a new challenge. Maybe find a friend to program with.</li>

			<h2>Today:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Did not go back into Cloudbees. Never again.</li>
<li>Moved repository to GitHub instead, and started using a Node.js webserver for development.</li>
<li>Hooked up Firebase to the Angular project and started adding items to Firebase database with my first controller.</li>
<li>Wrote a few short JavaScript functions to (1) see how many items there are, (2) see how many are remaining and (3) calculate and show the progress.</li>
<li>My model is as follows, at the moment: An array of item objects, which have a name (text) and status (true/false). False is not done. True means it&rsquo;s checked and done.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Road blocks:</h2>

<ul>
<li>GUID URL generation and persisting into database. I will need to (1) create a new URL for each new checklist, (2) save that ID into the database with the array of items with statuses and names. When a user returns to that specific URL, the user will see that same list. It will not refresh and go blank (like it currently does).</li>
<li>Have not done any test-writing yet. But I want to! I&rsquo;ve been writing in Sublime Text, console.log() into console and running the app. I would like to test, though.</li>
<li>Down the line, we need to figure out how to deploy &ndash; Heroku or GitHub pages?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tomorrow:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I hope to set up testing somehow, with Jasmine, Karma or whatever.</li>
<li>I hope to start saving and persisting data, even if I don&rsquo;t have unique URLs yet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code challenges:</h2>

<ul>
<li>To make up for what I didn&rsquo;t do yesterday, I did a Ruby exercism.io and a JavaScript one.</li>
<li>I will push them to GitHub as soon as they are approved.</li>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/08/23/log-0/">Log 0</a></h1>
		<time>23 August 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Inspired by JZ and Vyki&rsquo;s <a href="http://dysania.github.io/blog/">Summer of Code Captain&rsquo;s Logs</a>, I&rsquo;ve decided I should organize my project progress, thoughts and homework every day. And what a good chance to practice writing and editing (in VIM and Markdown, no less.) There will be as little bikeshed-painting, yak-shaving as possible! Yesterday JZ and Vyki presented the lessons they&rsquo;ve learned so far from diving into open source coding. One of the Pivotal Labs developers also talked about their dedication to being enabling and empowering by being transparent, constantly shipping and iterating and sharing best practices. Although I&rsquo;m not working on this project as a pair, I want to keep myself accountable by writing a &ldquo;stand-up&rdquo; every day.</p>

<h2>What I did today:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish writing user story process.</li>
<li>Finish writing preliminary milestones. Put it all on <a href="https://github.com/machikoyasuda/angular-checklist">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Finish writing user stories into Pivotal Tracker &ndash; haven&rsquo;t written all specific tasks yet.</li>
<li>Finish first wireframe and start a working prototype in HTML/CSS.</li>
<li>Start using iOS Simulator to see how prototype renders in iPhone.</li>
<li>Start thinking about my development environment, testing frameworks, things like that.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What I am curious about and Googling:</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post questions I&rsquo;ve been thinking about and what I&rsquo;ve Googled and read about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Front-end: Can I use Sass or LESS with Angular? What about Twitter Bootstrap? What kind of responsive grid do I want? (Yes on the first two questions).</li>
<li>Testing: What testing frameworks can I use with Jasmine? (You can use Cucumber.js).</li>
<li>Mobile-first design: What user experience considerations should I be thinking about? Mouse-overs, hovers won&rsquo;t really work. The checkbox will have to be well-designed and sized to fit the finger. Each item row will have to have enough height to be readable, clickable, editable. I have to take in consideration the keyboard that pops in and out. Typography and colors will matter even more. I&rsquo;ll have to immediately test how it looks and feels when the mobile keyboard pops up and takes up most of the page.</li>
<li>I learned it all from this series of blog posts on <a href="http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/02/ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-1-of-3/">Angular</a> <a href="http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/06/angularjs-best-practices-ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-2-of-3/">best</a> <a href="http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/08/angularjs-best-practices-ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-3-of-3/">practices</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s next:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start Sass or LESS with mobile viewports.</li>
<li>Start Jasmine testing soon.</li>
<li>Deploy as soon as I can, so I can run a real test on an iPhone.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Practice of the day:</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to tackle a programming problem every day. Here are some exercises I&rsquo;ve been trying and liking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exercism.io (JavaScript and Ruby)</li>
<li>Ruby Warrior</li>
<li>Ruby Koans</li>
<li>JavaScript Koans</li>
<li>Finally finish Learn Ruby the Hard Way</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a strange, short-term memory these days. Memories will come back to me like vivid movie scenes, but if you asked me what I did seven days ago — I might come up blank. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the learning and working.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s been changing my week so far though, has been the simple act of committing each minor project accomplishment as a git commit.</p>

<p>Version Control on git is not just for easier collaborating and sharing work, I&rsquo;ve realized. I can look back on my commits from a month or two months back and re-read some jQuery I wrote to refresh my brain on syntax and methods. Or I can go back and see what I&rsquo;ve done in the past week.</p>

<p>Projects are daunting. Starting at zero and trying to get to the finish line in one long leap is a daunting leap to make. Instead of fretting over getting it perfect the first time, I&rsquo;ve been celebrating each tiny little commit. Because it&rsquo;s those little steps in between that will get me there.</p>

&ldquo;Keep learning fun — you&rsquo;ll have more dopamine in your system and your memory will skyrocket.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Write, even if you don&rsquo;t publish. You will learn from it&rdquo;
On side projects for learning: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if someone else did it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Everyone here is free to be wrong.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Trying fails, awareness cures.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t warehouse knowledge.&rdquo;

			<h2>How my mom learned how to make California rolls, or, reason #321 why my mom is rad</h2>

<p>My mom grew up in a seaside merchant town on the southern island of Japan. She grew up learning how to eat a whole fish with chopsticks, carefully picking out the spine out of the fish. She can slice a raw squid without getting the ink all over herself. Of course, she rolls sushi.</p>

<p>But even after she moved to Los Angeles, she did not know how to make a California roll. A California roll, if you don&rsquo;t know, has rice on the outside &mdash; not the inside.</p>

<p>So what did she do? At the local grocery store with a sushi bar and deli, she asked the chef if she could learn some time. He said yes. One morning before I left for first-grade, she woke up extra early and left the house to learn. She got behind the sushi counter and learned from the pros. Now she knows how to make California rolls.</p>

<h2>I still remember the first time I rolled a Spanish rr</h2>

<p>My journey in learning Spanish started the summer before 8th grade. When we learned the alphabet, I still remember quite painfully &mdash; I couldn&rsquo;t roll my tongue to make the &ldquo;rr&rdquo;.</p>

<p>By the time we started a full-year Spanish I course in 8th grade, I still couldn&rsquo;t get that tongue to move up and down to make the Spanish &ldquo;rr.&rdquo; I asked our teacher, Señorita Hyatt, how I could learn, if I could even learn and how to practice. She told me to practice saying &ldquo;errre&rdquo;. Just loosen the tongue and practice over and over.</p>

<p>One day, in 5th period PE class after lunch, I was telling my friends how it was so hard for me to learn. We changed in the locker room and walked down the portable slope. And then, like magic, out of no where, a real tip-of-the-tongue &ldquo;rr&rdquo; slipped out. In disbelief, I tried it again. And it was a real &ldquo;rr&rdquo;! I was so happy. I&rsquo;ll never forget this moment.</p>

<h2>Subject-verb agreement IRL</h2>

<p>Japanese is my first language. My parents spoke to my brothers and I in Japanese as we grew up. Until we started pre-school at a local Jewish congregation, we&rsquo;d never spoken it. Though now English is my strongest language, I grew up listening to the type of English spoken by immigrants — not entirely colloquial, not always grammatically-correct either.</p>

<p>When it came time to learn grammar in school, I remember some of it sounded so wrong to me. So foreign.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ll never forget those days after my high school friends and I had taken the PSAT &ndash; the junior level of the SAT &ndash; and my friend proclaimed that the grammar questions were so easy. &ldquo;All you have to do is say the sentences out loud, and you can <em>hear</em> which sentence is correct,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d explained afterwards while we were in line at the local movie theater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the sentence is, &lsquo;everyone gets their license at age 16&rsquo; it should be &lsquo;everyone gets <em>his</em> or <em>her</em> license at age 16.&rsquo; It just sounds correct!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t sound correct to me.</p>

<p>Had I grown up listening to botched English all along? Even on the news radio or cartoons?</p>

<p>It shocked me a little bit. I always got A&rsquo;s in English class. I could memorize some grammar rules and regurgitate them correctly on a test. But I hadn&rsquo;t trained myself to hear or speak English correctly, as per the College Board.</p>

<p>I spent the summer trapped in SAT class, learning textbook English Grammar. Now I can read and hear those subject-verb agreement errors as &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;incorrect.&rdquo; I cringe every time I see a sign at the grocery store that says, &ldquo;Express Lanes: 10 Items of Less.&rdquo; I had to re-teach myself how I speak and write English.</p>

<p>The whole experience left me with a bitter memory.</p>

<p>Newspaper copy editors guard grammar, syntax and style rules, not because of the rules themselves, but because following those rules helps readers better understand the text. I&rsquo;d adopted that view too. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s terrible that the SAT tests whether we can understand these kinds of sentences correctly.</p>

<p>But I felt disadvantaged growing up around people who did not speak it correctly. I grew up listening to that, and that felt correct to me. And we communicated just fine.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I try very hard to speak correctly. Not because I&rsquo;m a grammar prick, but because I want people to hear what they might get in some stupid standardized test sometime in the future.</p>
