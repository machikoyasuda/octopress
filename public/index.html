			<h1>Today:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Learning about try/catch/finally/throw. [<a href="https://gist.github.com/machikoyasuda/6373231">https://gist.github.com/machikoyasuda/6373231</a>]</li>
<li>try: the function you are testing</li>
<li>catch(e): the fall-back function in case try does not work.</li>
<li>finally: always runs &ndash; usually an alert. optional.</li>
<li>throw: define different variations of the catch &ldquo;e&rdquo;, like NaN, out of range exceptions.</li>
<li>Did a little Mustache.js: [<a href="https://github.com/machikoyasuda/mustache-js-test">https://github.com/machikoyasuda/mustache-js-test</a>]</li>
<li>I think I will get to implement some Mustache.js in my Datamap project. I will insert things like Census report name or table name into the JSON, and use it later on the front-end.</li>
<li>On my project, I added some new stylings, but no new JavaScript functions. The data now persists to database.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Roadblocks:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Should users be able to edit item names? If so, what&rsquo;s the best mobile UI for that? A button or something else?</li>
<li>Tomorrow I plan to start generating unique URL with an unique ID for each checklist. That ID must somehow correspond with the correct Firebase collection.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Tonight:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Figure out how to run my Jasmine/Karma tests.</li>
</ul>


<h1>Code challenge:</h1>

<ul>
<li>Start nit-picking for Ruby and JS excercism.</li>
<li>Start a new challenge. Maybe find a friend to program with.</li>
</ul>

		<time>27 August 2013</time>

		<div class="content">
			<h2>Today:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Did not go back into Cloudbees. Never again.</li>
<li>Moved repository to GitHub instead, and started using a Node.js webserver for development.</li>
<li>Hooked up Firebase to the Angular project and started adding items to Firebase database with my first controller.</li>
<li>Wrote a few short JavaScript functions to (1) see how many items there are, (2) see how many are remaining and (3) calculate and show the progress.</li>
<li>My model is as follows, at the moment: An array of item objects, which have a name (text) and status (true/false). False is not done. True means it&rsquo;s checked and done.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Road blocks:</h2>

<ul>
<li>GUID URL generation and persisting into database. I will need to (1) create a new URL for each new checklist, (2) save that ID into the database with the array of items with statuses and names. When a user returns to that specific URL, the user will see that same list. It will not refresh and go blank (like it currently does).</li>
<li>Have not done any test-writing yet. But I want to! I&rsquo;ve been writing in Sublime Text, console.log() into console and running the app. I would like to test, though.</li>
<li>Down the line, we need to figure out how to deploy &ndash; Heroku or GitHub pages?</li>
</ul>


<h2>Tomorrow:</h2>

<ul>
<li>I hope to set up testing somehow, with Jasmine, Karma or whatever.</li>
<li>I hope to start saving and persisting data, even if I don&rsquo;t have unique URLs yet.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Code challenges:</h2>

<ul>
<li>To make up for what I didn&rsquo;t do yesterday, I did a Ruby exercism.io and a JavaScript one.</li>
<li>I will push them to GitHub as soon as they are approved.</li>
</ul>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/08/23/log-0/">Log 0</a></h1>
		<time>23 August 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>Inspired by JZ and Vyki&rsquo;s <a href="http://dysania.github.io/blog/">Summer of Code Captain&rsquo;s Logs</a>, I&rsquo;ve decided I should organize my project progress, thoughts and homework every day. And what a good chance to practice writing and editing (in VIM and Markdown, no less.) There will be as little bikeshed-painting, yak-shaving as possible! Yesterday JZ and Vyki presented the lessons they&rsquo;ve learned so far from diving into open source coding. One of the Pivotal Labs developers also talked about their dedication to being enabling and empowering by being transparent, constantly shipping and iterating and sharing best practices. Although I&rsquo;m not working on this project as a pair, I want to keep myself accountable by writing a &ldquo;stand-up&rdquo; every day.</p>

<h2>What I did today:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Finish writing user story process.</li>
<li>Finish writing preliminary milestones. Put it all on <a href="https://github.com/machikoyasuda/angular-checklist">GitHub</a></li>
<li>Finish writing user stories into Pivotal Tracker &ndash; haven&rsquo;t written all specific tasks yet.</li>
<li>Finish first wireframe and start a working prototype in HTML/CSS.</li>
<li>Start using iOS Simulator to see how prototype renders in iPhone.</li>
<li>Start thinking about my development environment, testing frameworks, things like that.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What I am curious about and Googling:</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ll post questions I&rsquo;ve been thinking about and what I&rsquo;ve Googled and read about it.</p>

<ul>
<li>Front-end: Can I use Sass or LESS with Angular? What about Twitter Bootstrap? What kind of responsive grid do I want? (Yes on the first two questions).</li>
<li>Testing: What testing frameworks can I use with Jasmine? (You can use Cucumber.js).</li>
<li>Mobile-first design: What user experience considerations should I be thinking about? Mouse-overs, hovers won&rsquo;t really work. The checkbox will have to be well-designed and sized to fit the finger. Each item row will have to have enough height to be readable, clickable, editable. I have to take in consideration the keyboard that pops in and out. Typography and colors will matter even more. I&rsquo;ll have to immediately test how it looks and feels when the mobile keyboard pops up and takes up most of the page.</li>
<li>I learned it all from this series of blog posts on <a href="http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/02/ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-1-of-3/">Angular</a> <a href="http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/06/angularjs-best-practices-ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-2-of-3/">best</a> <a href="http://blog.artlogic.com/2013/05/08/angularjs-best-practices-ive-been-doing-it-wrong-part-3-of-3/">practices</a>.</li>
</ul>


<h2>What&rsquo;s next:</h2>

<ul>
<li>Start Sass or LESS with mobile viewports.</li>
<li>Start Jasmine testing soon.</li>
<li>Deploy as soon as I can, so I can run a real test on an iPhone.</li>
</ul>


<h2>Practice of the day:</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m going to tackle a programming problem every day. Here are some exercises I&rsquo;ve been trying and liking:</p>

<ul>
<li>Exercism.io (JavaScript and Ruby)</li>
<li>Ruby Warrior</li>
<li>Ruby Koans</li>
<li>JavaScript Koans</li>
<li>Finally finish Learn Ruby the Hard Way</li>
</ul>

<p>I have a strange, short-term memory these days. Memories will come back to me like vivid movie scenes, but if you asked me what I did seven days ago — I might come up blank. Maybe it&rsquo;s all the learning and working.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s been changing my week so far though, has been the simple act of committing each minor project accomplishment as a git commit.</p>

<p>Version Control on git is not just for easier collaborating and sharing work, I&rsquo;ve realized. I can look back on my commits from a month or two months back and re-read some jQuery I wrote to refresh my brain on syntax and methods. Or I can go back and see what I&rsquo;ve done in the past week.</p>

<p>Projects are daunting. Starting at zero and trying to get to the finish line in one long leap is a daunting leap to make. Instead of fretting over getting it perfect the first time, I&rsquo;ve been celebrating each tiny little commit. Because it&rsquo;s those little steps in between that will get me there.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;Be resilient to failure. It&rsquo;s like wearing a bulletproof vest.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Shit is easier. I make it myself.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Keep learning fun — you&rsquo;ll have more dopamine in your system and your memory will skyrocket.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Write, even if you don&rsquo;t publish. You will learn from it&rdquo;
On side projects for learning: &ldquo;It doesn&rsquo;t matter if someone else did it.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Everyone here is free to be wrong.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Trying fails, awareness cures.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t warehouse knowledge.&rdquo;
&ldquo;If design is the how, art direction is the why, front-end is the what and back-end is the factory. Digital is the norm&rdquo;</p></blockquote>

			<h2>How my mom learned how to make California rolls, or, reason #321 why my mom is rad</h2>

<p>My mom grew up in a seaside merchant town on the southern island of Japan. She grew up learning how to eat a whole fish with chopsticks, carefully picking out the spine out of the fish. She can slice a raw squid without getting the ink all over herself. Of course, she rolls sushi.</p>

<p>But even after she moved to Los Angeles, she did not know how to make a California roll. A California roll, if you don&rsquo;t know, has rice on the outside &mdash; not the inside.</p>

<p>So what did she do? At the local grocery store with a sushi bar and deli, she asked the chef if she could learn some time. He said yes. One morning before I left for first-grade, she woke up extra early and left the house to learn. She got behind the sushi counter and learned from the pros. Now she knows how to make California rolls.</p>

<h2>I still remember the first time I rolled a Spanish rr</h2>

<p>My journey in learning Spanish started the summer before 8th grade. When we learned the alphabet, I still remember quite painfully &mdash; I couldn&rsquo;t roll my tongue to make the &ldquo;rr&rdquo;.</p>

<p>By the time we started a full-year Spanish I course in 8th grade, I still couldn&rsquo;t get that tongue to move up and down to make the Spanish &ldquo;rr.&rdquo; I asked our teacher, Señorita Hyatt, how I could learn, if I could even learn and how to practice. She told me to practice saying &ldquo;errre&rdquo;. Just loosen the tongue and practice over and over.</p>

<p>One day, in 5th period PE class after lunch, I was telling my friends how it was so hard for me to learn. We changed in the locker room and walked down the portable slope. And then, like magic, out of no where, a real tip-of-the-tongue &ldquo;rr&rdquo; slipped out. In disbelief, I tried it again. And it was a real &ldquo;rr&rdquo;! I was so happy. I&rsquo;ll never forget this moment.</p>

<h2>Subject-verb agreement IRL</h2>

<p>Japanese is my first language. My parents spoke to my brothers and I in Japanese as we grew up. Until we started pre-school at a local Jewish congregation, we&rsquo;d never spoken it. Though now English is my strongest language, I grew up listening to the type of English spoken by immigrants — not entirely colloquial, not always grammatically-correct either.</p>

<p>When it came time to learn grammar in school, I remember some of it sounded so wrong to me. So foreign.</p>

<p>But I&rsquo;ll never forget those days after my high school friends and I had taken the PSAT &ndash; the junior level of the SAT &ndash; and my friend proclaimed that the grammar questions were so easy. &ldquo;All you have to do is say the sentences out loud, and you can <em>hear</em> which sentence is correct,&rdquo; he&rsquo;d explained afterwards while we were in line at the local movie theater.</p>

<p>&ldquo;If the sentence is, &lsquo;everyone gets their license at age 16&rsquo; it should be &lsquo;everyone gets <em>his</em> or <em>her</em> license at age 16.&rsquo; It just sounds correct!&rdquo;</p>

<p>But it didn&rsquo;t sound correct to me.</p>

<p>Had I grown up listening to botched English all along? Even on the news radio or cartoons?</p>

<p>It shocked me a little bit. I always got A&rsquo;s in English class. I could memorize some grammar rules and regurgitate them correctly on a test. But I hadn&rsquo;t trained myself to hear or speak English correctly, as per the College Board.</p>

<p>I spent the summer trapped in SAT class, learning textbook English Grammar. Now I can read and hear those subject-verb agreement errors as &ldquo;correct&rdquo; or &ldquo;incorrect.&rdquo; I cringe every time I see a sign at the grocery store that says, &ldquo;Express Lanes: 10 Items of Less.&rdquo; I had to re-teach myself how I speak and write English.</p>

<p>The whole experience left me with a bitter memory.</p>

<p>Newspaper copy editors guard grammar, syntax and style rules, not because of the rules themselves, but because following those rules helps readers better understand the text. I&rsquo;d adopted that view too. I don&rsquo;t think it&rsquo;s terrible that the SAT tests whether we can understand these kinds of sentences correctly.</p>

<p>But I felt disadvantaged growing up around people who did not speak it correctly. I grew up listening to that, and that felt correct to me. And we communicated just fine.</p>

<p>Nowadays, I try very hard to speak correctly. Not because I&rsquo;m a grammar prick, but because I want people to hear what they might get in some stupid standardized test sometime in the future.</p>

		<h1><a href="/blog/2013/06/23/rough-draft-idea/">are computers bicycles for the mind? or cars?</a></h1>
		<time>23 June 2013</time>
	</header>
		<div class="content">
			<p>In this technology-driven world, how do we humans interact with the machines around us? In my mind, there are at least two categories: (1) letting the machine control you, (2) you controlling the machine.</p>

<p>One of the biggest differences in my mind about my car vs. my bicycle, is that it&rsquo;s not so easy to change parts around in my car. Sure, I can look under the hood, check the oil levels and if I tried really hard, perhaps I could change a few easy parts: a wind-shield wiper or something. It would be a lot harder to swap out the seats, carpet or any machinery inside.</p>

<p>On a broader level, I&rsquo;m not even sure how it really <em>works</em>. It wasn&rsquo;t until I was really studying bicycle gearing that I started to understand how a stick shift car operates. It&rsquo;s easier of course, to see what&rsquo;s going on with your bike as there&rsquo;s no hood to take off. As I&rsquo;m biking, I can look down and see what front chain-ring I&rsquo;m in.</p>

<p>All of our slick hardware these days &ndash; this MacBook Air, an iPhone, a Garmin, Jawbone, iPod, microwaves even &ndash; all lock us out of any inside components. Somewhere in between the low price of gadgets, the high turnover of our manufactured obsolescence and attention spans and yearly product cycles, we let ourselves get locked out of any way of controlling the machine. We can&rsquo;t see inside of it to see how it&rsquo;s working. On our favorite, beloved Apple products, we can&rsquo;t even replace the battery.</p>

<p>Sure, you can download apps to your iPhone or laptop, try to get a mechanic to fix a microwave, but you still can&rsquo;t add new tasks, change their functions. We are stuck. Controlled by the machine. Once it&rsquo;s broken, we are doomed.</p>

<p>The cycle just goes: Purchase, use, buy more accessories for it, re-charge, use until the battery dies (or you buy another one), throw away the product and said accessories, repeat.</p>

<p>Learning bicycle mechanics and more recently, programming, has put me out of that boring cycle. I&rsquo;ve put my 1993 swap meet Bridgestone XO-3 through at least five iterations now with narrower up-right handlebars, platform pedals, wider tires, new rack and panniers. I experimented with what saddle and handlebar height I liked better, what handlebar tape I preferred, which location for the brake levers were best for city riding.</p>

<p>After many experiments and parts swapped, the bike fits on me better and is more like a natural extension of my limbs. I&rsquo;m a rolling, two-wheeled machine.</p>

<p>Every time I change out parts, your body will notice how it has to change its actions to better fit the bike. I don&rsquo;t have to brake as early or as hard, not that my levers are right by my hands. I&rsquo;ve aligned the derailleur so many times, I know exactly how many gears I have and where I need to set the shifter to get it there. The bike does not control me; I control, shift, twist and change it to my needs. I don&rsquo;t have to look down at my gears &mdash; I can feel where it is. If there&rsquo;s ever a derailleur hangup, I can hear it and usually, fix it with my hands. As long as I keep the chain lubed and tires pumped, my body can move over 15 miles per hour, no sweat.</p>

<blockquote><p>&ldquo;And that’s what a computer is to me. What a computer is to me is it’s the most remarkable tool that we’ve ever come up with, and it’s the equivalent of a bicycle for our minds.&rdquo; &mdash; Steve Jobs, 1990</p></blockquote>

<p>But have you ever watched someone bike up a hill in his largest (hardest) gear? It&rsquo;s painful to watch. He might not understand why he&rsquo;s in a gear that&rsquo;s too hard to pedal, and might not make it up at all. You cannot let the bike control you.</p>

<p>To me, this is the key between merely consuming the machine and controlling it.</p>

<p><em>If a bicycle is a computer for our minds, we must learn how the machine talks, listens and understands the commands we give it.</em>We have to learn how to get it into the right gear to go up hills or down. Fix flats and bugs. Keep the chain and battery in top shape.</p>

<p>This is what is missing from our education today. When I hear a school district is buying everyone laptops, iPads, the new technological phenomenon the skeptic in me thinks about how we&rsquo;re just teaching our children to follow the corporation and consume, consume, consume. Buy more apps. Nag our parents to buy more TV shows or games. Yet we aren&rsquo;t teaching the most crucial thing: how to make apps and games, how to open up the iPad and learn to speak its language and make the iPad to things for us.</p>

<p>In my 6th grade driver&rsquo;s ed, I learned how to drive and how to consume more gas. I didn&rsquo;t learn how to fix flats or even really how cars worked. Looks like our schools may be headed towards teaching how to buy apps, change your typeface on your PowerPoint, take photos with PhotoBooth and Instagram &mdash; but will they teach how to make apps and talk to the machine?</p>

			<p>Learning how to type, mouse, click efficiently is all part of learning how to make your computer do stuff. It&rsquo;s part of communicating with the machine itself. Like constantly practicing and training your bow hand and fingering on the violin, you aim for precision and speed with keyboard shortcuts and typing. I&rsquo;m liking Notational Velocity (for notes), iTerm2 (Command Line) and a combination of Vim and Sublime Text 2. This week I learned about SizeUp, which I&rsquo;ve been using to divide my 13 inch MacBook Air screen into tiles of apps. Especially for those with smaller laptops and no extra monitors &ndash; highly recommend trying SizeUp.</p>
