"One of the biggest problems on software development teams in communication."

Try to tackle learning by problem-first, project-first, rather than requirements-first. 

The first part of a project is coming up with the problem, planning the data structure and sketching a wireframe. The data structure tree and the wireframes are mostly a communication tool â€” you can bring it up to colleagues and bosses and start talking about specifics. 

In the same way we'd plan how to schedule our project time, we can schedule our learning as well.
