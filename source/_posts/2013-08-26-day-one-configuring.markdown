## Today:
- Start CloudBees account with a basic Angular.JS build from Angular-Seed
- It took a really long time.
- Learned a little bit about ng-controller and ng-model, filters and directives.

## Challenges:
- I will have to generate unique URLs for each checklist. I'm wondering how I'll do that...

## Tonight:
- Watching this video on making real-time web apps with Angjuar.js and Firebase: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C7ZI7z7qnHU

## Code challenge of the day: 
-None. Yet. :(

## Life / Home:
- I'm reading Flow by Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi. Jeff Casimir, aka @J3, recommended the book during his presentation at LA Ruby the other month.
