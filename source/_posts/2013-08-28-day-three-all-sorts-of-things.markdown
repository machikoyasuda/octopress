## Today:
- Learning about [try-catch-finally-throw](https://gist.github.com/machikoyasuda/6373231) See the gist there.
- try: the function you are testing
- catch(e): the fall-back function in case try does not work.
- finally: always runs - usually an alert. optional.
- throw: define different variations of the catch "e", like NaN, out of range exceptions.
- Did a little [Mustache.js](https://github.com/machikoyasuda/mustache-js-test). See the code there.
- I think I will get to implement some Mustache.js in my Datamap project. I will insert things like Census report name or table name into the JSON, and use it later on the front-end.
- On my project, I added some new stylings, but no new JavaScript functions. The data now persists to database.

## Roadblocks:
- Should users be able to edit item names? If so, what's the best mobile UI for that? A button or something else?
- Tomorrow I plan to start generating unique URL with an unique ID for each checklist. That ID must somehow correspond with the correct Firebase collection.

## Tonight:
- Figure out how to run my Jasmine/Karma tests.

## Code challenge:
- Start nit-picking for Ruby and JS excercism.
- Start a new challenge. Maybe find a friend to program with.
