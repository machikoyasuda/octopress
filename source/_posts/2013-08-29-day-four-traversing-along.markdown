## Today:
Today our group took a different approach. We talked about our main back-end roadblocks and broke up into groups to tackle them together.

What did I learn? The amazing/insane/crazy thing in programming is when you think you've applied all the same methods to your friend's project -- and the results are not the same as yours. Group-debugging is much better than self-debugging. 

## Roadblocks:

My personal roadblocks, prioritized:


1. Back-end: URL generation + new Firebase collection. This involves a sequence of steps:

- Create new Firebase collection
- Generate new URL accordingly
- Prompt user to bookmark that link, share with friends



Everything else after this is not so much part of the MVP.

It would be nice to learn things like: jQuery Mobile, Sass, more about viewports/media queries, mobile interactions...


# Tomorrow:
3. Testing: how to set up Karma
4. Still work on URL.


## Next week:
5. Deploying!
