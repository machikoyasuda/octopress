I am a journalist learning web development in Los Angeles, Calif. I appreciate good syntax in code and prose.

I spent the summer of 2013 immersing myself in front-end and back-end web development at General Assembly Los Angeles. With my newfound skillset, I'd like to combine technology with the creative liberal arts to push the world forward.

Find my code on [GitHub](http://github.com/machikoyasuda/ "Machiko Yasuda's GitHub"). Follow my ephemera on [Twitter](http://twitter.com/machikoyasuda "Twitter"). Find me at LA Ruby meetups on Thursday nights, bouldering and bicycling on weekends.

See my [resume](https://dl.dropboxusercontent.com/u/6093064/Machiko%20Yasuda%20-%20r%C3%A9sum%C3%A9.pdf) here.
